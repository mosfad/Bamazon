# Bamazon
## Amazon-like storefront that will accept customer orders and update inventory.
Bamazon is a multi-platform app which allows customers to order products and managers to track and update inventory. When the customer view app is run, it displays the available products in the store with their pricing and stock amounts. The customer can make an order by providing the product's id number and the product quantity. The app will process the order and give a sum, if the stock quantity is sufficient, otherwise the order is canceled.

When the manager view app is run, it also displays a list of menu options. These options allow the manager to view all available products in the store with their pricing and stock amounts, view the products that have a low inventory level, increase inventory levels for any product, and add a new product to the store.

The app is designed to help customers purchase products online, and managers track and update inventory. The customer and manager views are synchronized to provide up to date information. A feature that I would like to include is a supervisor view, which would allow a supervisor to track the performance of various departments within the store.

*Please note that the program see the videos below to see how the customer and manager views run*. low.
